1
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
What's happening in Sacramento?

2
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,500
lfyou want to double the TV ads do that.
l just want results.

3
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Yes, Kathy.

4
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Sunny, John's waiting foryou.

5
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,900
Yeah.

6
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,600
What have you got for me?

7
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,800
This is the current trend map. Red
is ours and it doesn't look good.

8
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Why've you given me a
bad map of goddamn India?!

9
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,700
Sir, you're holding it upside down.
You should just turn it.

10
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
- Red is us.
-We need to invest more on TV ads.

11
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,500
You are my campaign manager.

12
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,200
You are an idiot.

13
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,800
Who the hell employed this guy?

14
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,500
- What the hell are you doing
to my campaign? - John...

15
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,700
We got to get people out there!
We got to get money out there!

16
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,000
l've never had stress
like this, even at Harvard.

17
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,000
l'm thinking of chucking
it all in and leaving.

18
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Buddy, winnen never quit.

19
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Look on the bright side...

20
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,200
lt'll be the first
time in American histoy

21
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,500
a guy from Kerala is heading
a campaign for Governor.

22
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,900
True. But l'll be in the grave by the
time l get this dumb guy to win.

23
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:46,600
That's true.

24
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,600
You're more stressed
than at business school.

25
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,900
Anyway, to get this thing done,
l've offered a sacrifice to God.

26
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

27
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,200
To shave your head.

28
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,700
Dude, a typical
Kerala Indian attitude!

29
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,300
We're the masters of backstabbing!

30
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,500
l'm not sure if my hair will grow back.
l'm ok with it though.

31
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,200
l'm ready to ty anything
to get this idiot to win.

32
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,100
Are you the same Sunny Kurishingal
who Time magazine called

33
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,600
''The Campaign Manager
with a Magic Wand''?

34
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,800
Sunny Kurishingal [Cross]
Now my surname means something!

35
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,200
l need to find a way to
increase Koy's ratings.

36
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,200
lf l can't find a
way to raise them,

37
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,600
l won't be able to sleep.

38
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,200
You want to raise Koy's?
How about raising yours?

39
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
Stop it.

40
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:08,800
Since your election strategies haven't
wo_ed out yet, let me give you an idea.

41
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,900
Evey Tom, Dick and Hary
is giving me ideas,

42
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,800
why keep youn back? Go ahead.

43
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Why don't you talk with your
friend, Francis Kunjappan?

44
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,100
The great Public Works minister
in Kerala, aka ''God's Own County''?

45
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,400
God's Own County?

46
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
Devil's Own Rulers!
Francis Kunjappan...

47
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,700
Only l know his true
face: Fraud Number 1 .

48
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
You're not tying to mary
your daughter o_ to him...

49
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,900
lt's to win the elections.
Frauds like him will be pe_ect.

50
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,900
You ask him. He'll
give you some ideas.

51
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
What can he do?

52
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,300
He would've passed his eighth grade
if he hadn't failed eight times.

53
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,400
The person who secures good grades
becomes a civil servant there

54
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,200
and the one who hangs around, throwing
stones at buses, is his governor.

55
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,100
That's India for you.

56
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,100
Come on, politics is
the same eveywhere.

57
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Back home, thieves
wear a shirt and dhoti

58
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
here they wear a suit and tie.

59
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
l've said my piece.

60
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,200
Someone from Kerala for US politics?

61
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,800
Why not? NASA, Apple,
Microsoft, doctor, engineer...

62
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,200
For brains, the US o_en
use people from back home.

63
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Whereas people from Kerala specialize in
backstabbing, cheating and so on.

64
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,900
Listen, what did Steve Jobs say?
''Stay hungy, think di_erent.''

65
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,400
Maybe, maybe....

66
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,900
Yes, yes. The report says there's
no problem in the structure ofthe dam.

67
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,000
What can we do then?

68
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,700
- l'll hand you over.
- Who?

69
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,400
- Sunny Kurishingal from America.
- Please call me later.

70
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,300
Hello. Who is this? The King ofAmerica?

71
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,000
So, Mr ''Emerging Kerala'',
what makes you call me?

72
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,200
Can't l call the Public Wo_s minister of
Kerala evey day to ask what he had for lunch?

73
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,000
- What's new in Kerala?
- Same old news.

74
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,100
When it's hot, it's a power cut..

75
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,100
Rain? Problems with
the Kerala Dam.

76
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,400
- Our dam? - It's not a dam. It's like
the snake round Lord Shiva's neck.

77
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,100
Remove it, you get bitten;
but you can't leave it there.

78
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Money. Money.

79
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
Have you brought all of it?

80
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,000
- Not here
- There are hidden cameras around.

81
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
l was talking to someone here.

82
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,100
So, what's new in America?

83
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,300
lt's an avalanche of news here.

84
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,000
California State Election. l'm
working to make our candidate win.

85
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,300
Actually that's
why l called you.

86
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,000
l need your help.

87
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,300
My friend. If l step aside now
to play American politics

88
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,400
then l can never return.

89
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,500
l'll spend my life running
a tea shop in LA.

90
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,500
No, no. What l
meant was this,

91
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,200
l need someone to help
sort this crap out here.

92
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
Someone like a consultant.

93
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,800
Money isn't a problem. l'm ready
to spend whatever it takes.

94
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,800
There are only two people in Kerala
with the brains for that sort ofthing.

95
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,800
One ofthem is me
but l can't come.

96
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,800
- The other person? - The other is
also me and l can't come either.

97
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,800
lt's time for a meeting now.
l'm hanging up.

98
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,300
- Ok, l'll call you. - Think about
what l said. - Bye, bye.

99
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
- Please.
- Hold this.

100
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Welcome, welcome.
Sir, please sit.

101
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
Please sit.

102
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,300
- Where were we?

103
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,900
- Let the central report stand.
- Stand where?

104
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,200
- Whatever you say. The people of
Kerala.... - Let it be. One minute.

105
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,000
Please don't murder Tamil.
Please speak Malayalam.

106
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,600
Central committee report...

107
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,800
clearly says no...
damage to the dam...

108
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,300
and there is no...

109
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,300
threat right?
Yes. Threat.

110
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,000
So it's ok to murder
English then?

111
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,200
- No but...

112
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,000
Anything can be written
in the report.

113
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,100
But the people in Kerala are scared.

114
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,900
What do we
tell the media?

115
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,500
We aren't able to sleep here.

116
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,900
- The area around the dam will
become a desert! - Sir...

117
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,200
- Don't stop my flow. - You've been
saying the same thing over and over.

118
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,100
Kerala people?! But what
will Tamil people do?

119
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
No solution. No coming.

120
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,800
- Who will solve it when they strike?
- Sir...

121
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,800
They keep tying to
make us understand.

122
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,900
Shall l talk to them? You
don't have to. Come.

123
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
The ego of these people.

124
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,500
lt's like that. When there's a problem,
all parties in Tamil Nadu gang together.

125
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,500
- Here, it's backstabbing.
- That's right.

126
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,900
Forget it. Do we have
a solution to this nonsense?

127
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,500
Now that all our
ideas have flopped,

128
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,500
shall we consult Jaganathan?

129
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:50,500
You mean the guy who wants to
take my job? Isn't there anyone else?

130
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:50,600
We haven't been able to do
anything for the past four days

131
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,000
so the Chief Minister
is vey anxious.

132
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,500
The only thing you're good for

133
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,700
is standing there wearing
a starched shirt.

134
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,200
You look good, but there's
nothing in your head.

135
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Okay, okay. Call that
annoying Jaganathan.

136
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,000
Four...

137
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,000
lt's not a four. Just two!
l'll give you mo.

138
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,300
What?

139
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,300
- l'll give you mo.
- Not acceptable!

140
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,800
lt's four. The
stone's the bounday.

141
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,700
You change the
rules as you go along.

142
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,600
When we batted, the
tree was the bounday.

143
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,100
Don't behave like a bad sport
when l hit a bounday.

144
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Hey umpire. What are you
standing there for?

145
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,800
- l signaled four already.
- Yes. It's a four. Go.

146
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,100
- Go bowl the next ball.
- The big ''bandicoot'' team...

147
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,800
Listen, don't get bowled
out and humiliated.

148
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
Just pay the bet and leave.

149
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,100
You'll never learn no matter
how many times we beat you.

150
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,600
There is still one ball le_.
You go bowl.

151
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Let them play. They must
score eight o_ one ball!

152
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,400
lt's Impossible so
Iet's see how they win.

153
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Eight runs from one ball. Don't
expect me to bowl a No Ball.

154
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,100
Eight runs from one ball?

155
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,300
Hello...

156
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh. One second, Sir.

157
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,300
Boss! Boss!

158
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,800
Minister Francis Kunjappan. He wants
to talk to you. It's an emergency.

159
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
To hell with Kuniappan.

160
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,500
lf l losethis, l might
as well leave the county.

161
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,800
l'm under pressure here. Don't come
to me with Kunjappan now.

162
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,700
Sir? He's dealing with another
big problem here at right now.

163
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,700
He'll call you back soon.

164
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,100
Hold this.

165
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,100
Come on. Hold this.

166
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Give.

167
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,400
He's folding his dhoti.
Game on!

168
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,300
- Come on. Bowl.
- Hey, hey...

169
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,900
Don't over do it. It's
difficult to get an eight.

170
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,100
l didn't want the dhoti
to get in the way when l run.

171
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
- l just said that for a build up.
- Hey...

172
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,600
No, no. l'm not doing it.

173
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Are you ready?

174
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Bowl.

175
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Cows.

176
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,600
- Cow! Cow! - He thinks he's
the national team captain.

177
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Catch the ball! Quick, quick!

178
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
Run and catch it!

179
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Run! Fast!

180
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
Don't stop running!

181
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:15,900
lt doesn't matter if it's in a cow pat.
Get the ball!

182
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,400
Quick! Quick!

183
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,400
Run!

184
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,900
Come on! Run!

185
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,800
Get the ball and throw it! Quick!

186
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,600
You come and take it ifyou want! My
mom'll kill me if l touch cow dung!

187
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,600
Run!

188
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,400
We iust need mo more runs.

189
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,500
We won!!!

190
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
What a game!

191
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Boss, that was great.

192
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
You can never beat us.

193
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Hey!

194
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,800
Winning or losing is not
important in a game.

195
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,300
Participate. Taking
part is important.

196
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
l just said that because l got the chance.
Please forgive me.

197
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,400
Go and buy something that
will make your belly ache.

198
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,700
-And us? - l'll give you something
that won't make your belly ache

199
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,100
Something that doesn't
make your belly ache.

200
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
Boss, that's a good one!

201
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Just a minute. One minute.

202
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,100
Can't you see what it says?
''Don't spit here.''

203
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
lt's in English.
It's for foreignen.

204
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,900
l'm from Kerala. l can spit.

205
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,700
- Do you want to spit?
- No, it's okay.

206
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,900
- Bless you.
- Bless you.

207
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
God bless.

208
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,100
Jaganathan. Come. Sit

209
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,800
- Jaganathan! Can l get you some co_ee?
- No, l just had some.

210
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,100
ln short. Neither pam is ready
to decide on the Kerala Dam issue.

211
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
They are...

212
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,900
- Both parties want to get out ofthis.
- No. They...

213
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Do one thing.

214
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,400
From tomorrow, charge all visitors from
other states to our Sabari Mala temple,

215
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,100
a five thousand rupee tax
on their offerings to God.

216
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,200
Tax offerings to God?
This man is talking nonsense.

217
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,200
Give us something
feasible at least.

218
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,000
Francis. Please send
this boy outside.

219
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,700
Send him out. Don't
annoy him.

220
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,700
l was the one who suggested calling him.
Now l'm out.

221
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,200
l should learn
politics from him.

222
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,500
He's gone.

223
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,000
lfwe announce this tax, the media in
other states will make this an issue.

224
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,500
They'll stir things up on all
the current a_ain programs.

225
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,000
This is a risky move Jaganathan.
But how will it help?

226
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:46,900
Redirection. Do people watch breaking
news until the stoy is over?

227
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
ln our county, the men watch breaking
news as much as the women watch soaps.

228
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
When they turn on the TV,
they want to see something new.

229
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Politicians and sex scandals, businessmen
and bribey, sports stars and drugs,

230
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
film awards and nepotism, drug companies
and hush ups, big business and pollution.

231
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:05,500
ln time, they're forgotten. No one
cares about yesterday's news.

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,500
People once involved in huge scandals
live here as role models now.

233
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,100
lndian people are forge_ul.

234
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,700
People aren't donkeys;
they won't buy it.

235
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
People have elected many
donkeys as ministen here.

236
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Our boss is a smart cookie.

237
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Boys, you've got to use yourfeet to
play football, not yourfingers.

238
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,100
There's been strong objection against
Kerala to the recently introduced tax

239
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,900
from Tamil Nadu and other states.

240
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,600
This decision has been made because ofthe
financial situation our state is facing.

241
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,700
l humbly request brothers from
the Tamil and other states

242
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,100
not to consider this an expense and to
co-operate with us to enforce this tax.

243
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,100
This has shocked all Sabari
Mala devotees of Tamil Nadu.

244
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,200
''Tax on the offerings to God.''

245
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,100
As always, you escaped thru
Jaganathan's brilliance!

246
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Change the channel.

247
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,300
- Changed... Show this energy in politics!
- Jaganathan! You..!

248
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
What he said is true.

249
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,100
Eveyone's forgotten the dam
and are talking about this tax.

250
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
He used to think about sports.

251
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,300
You brought him into politics.
See what's happened,

252
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,900
he's treating politics
like a sport now.

253
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
That's true.

254
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,400
His idea wasn't all that great.

255
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,200
- That's also true. - Even small
children now... - No, no!

256
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Shut up.

257
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Did you get this idea when people from other
states were scrapping here forfour days?

258
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,800
lts betterwe cut
Jaganathan o_ at the root.

259
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
Whatever he touches
turns to gold.

260
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,400
lt's cheap to create one
problem to escape from another.

261
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,300
That is so right.

262
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,200
This can only happen in our county.
Nowhere else.

263
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,700
Anywhere else, he'd
be behind bars.

264
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,200
Rewind what you said.

265
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,700
- Bars?
- Behind bars...

266
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,100
Not the bars. Rewind
a little more.

267
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,400
- This wouldn't happen in another county.
-Another county! That's a good point.

268
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,100
- This is why you're called a lioness.
- That is also right.

269
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Don't clap.

270
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,900
My ratings are
down the hole too.

271
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,000
l'm working on it John. l'm tying
to get a consultant from India.

272
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
- Yeah. Whatever.
- Trust me John.

273
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Your fault!

274
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,900
Go do some goddamn work!

275
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey, Go get the club!

276
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Come on, come on, come on!

277
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,800
Emerging Kerala.

278
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,800
- Thank God.
- Hello.

279
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
l apologize for troubling you.

280
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
lt's urgent. Please can you do
something about my problem?

281
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,300
lfyou can, l'll build a Taj
Mahal foryou in Kerala.

282
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,200
ln that case, start looking
for a plot of land.

283
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,100
l don't want money. Tell me what
you will give me personally.

284
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,400
What's happening?
Flirting in the sun?

285
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,400
- Is this a new scandal?
- No she's my friend's wife.

286
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,200
The minister is waiting foryou. He's
playing a weird game with sticks and balls.

287
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,400
Put the ball so l
can hit it easily.

288
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Place it on the tee.

289
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,300
Hello Jaganathan. Get a club.
Let's play.

290
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,200
- No. l am used to playing
with bigger balls. -True...

291
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,200
lt's di_icult to hit
this into the hole.

292
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,100
These days, we've got to learn this
to meet big shots in the county.

293
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,900
- Sathyasheela, get Jaganathan a beer
from the cooler. - No it's okay.

294
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,300
l don't mix games and drinks.

295
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
That's a good sportsman.
By the way,

296
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:31,900
the government gave you the land,
foundations are laid. It's been mo years.

297
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
What happened to
your sports academy?

298
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Have you lost
interest in it?

299
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,800
l have some financial issues. But
l have to start work this year.

300
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:42,900
There are only mo years before
a new government comes in.

301
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,500
Build the academy and
start classes before that

302
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,900
otherwise the next government will build
a mall there. That's the trend now.

303
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,400
Move aside. Please move aside.
This is a special kind of shot.

304
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,900
That was just a rehearsal. The
real shot isjust coming.

305
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
l asked him to put
the ball on the tee.

306
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,600
l don't believe it when you
say you don't have money.

307
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,100
There are many ways
to make money.

308
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,500
This sports academy is
notjust a building.

309
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,500
lt is a place where the dreams and
futures of people can be forged.

310
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,300
l'm adamant that the money that goes into
building it has to be earned honestly.

311
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,200
l know you're adamant about certain
things. That's why l called you.

312
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,400
A_er all, you've pulled me out
from a tight spot more than once.

313
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Don't l have to do something
for you in return?

314
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
Athree month iob.

315
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,500
Three hundred million rupees.
Location: America.

316
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Currency dollars...
five million dollars!

317
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,400
Do you want to give it a go?

318
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,300
Let's rock. Let's
stir things up.

319
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,200
Let's fly high.

320
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,500
lf you stand against him.
You'll be turned to ashes.

321
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,100
Let's fight and win.

322
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:55,100
Let's fight and fly higher
with the wind of change...

323
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, dream that was nurtured
for days, stand by my side.

324
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,800
Let's rock. Let's
stir things up.

325
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,200
Let's fly high.

326
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,200
Please give our students a
Iecture about swimming.

327
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:25,600
l'll meet you in person later
and give you the details.

328
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Ok?

329
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,200
Ok. Thank you so much.

330
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,000
- Who is it?
- What?

331
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,800
Kutral Easwar. Do you know him?

332
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,200
l know. Isn't he that
thug from the south?

333
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
- You're right!
- l know him.

334
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,800
You know Britney Spean
and Justin Bieber...

335
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,200
but not Kutral Easwar!
He's an Indian!

336
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,400
Kutral Easwar. The youngest man in
India to win the highest sports award.

337
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:53,500
He swam across evey sea in
the world within a year.

338
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600
He was the future of India.

339
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,500
Lately, he is doing some job in
America as he didn't get a sponsor.

340
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:04,200
He is brainy. That's why
he stopped swimming.

341
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,700
There is no shortage of
brainy people in India.

342
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,700
We're short of shame.

343
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Our population is the
biggest in the world...

344
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,500
but we're bottom ofthe
Olympic medal tally.

345
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:18,800
lf population gromh were a sport, India
would've won more medals than anyone.

346
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:22,900
lsn't that why we're
building a sports academy?

347
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,400
Just an academy is not enough forthat.
People's mentality needs to change.

348
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,900
People must understand there
are other sports as good as cricket

349
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,700
and that you can live happily here
even if you play those games too.

350
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,300
That's also why l've
accepted thisAmerican trip.

351
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,400
l wonder why the people in America
are asking foryour help.

352
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,700
Only local countymen like you

353
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,500
don't value me.

354
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
America is a county
that respects brains.

355
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,900
Don't you need a passport?

356
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:49,900
No.

357
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,900
These days they askfor
libray cards at the airport.

358
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,400
God! Are these the ones who are
going to come with me to America?

359
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:35,400
White birds in the sty flew across to
the festival packed with elephants.

360
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,300
The heavy clouds that were
a burden to the shoulders

361
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,000
have moved on a_erthe
showers ofthe monsoon.

362
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,300
Let's go across the banks ofthe
river and play rhyming games!

363
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,500
Let's jump into the sea,
get soaked and go fishing!

364
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,600
Let's reap harvests! Let's
make our dreams come true!

365
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,000
Let's raise our flags in our
colomul path, like excited birds!

366
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,800
Let's rock! Let's
stir things up!

367
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Let's fly high!

368
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,800
The breeze that comes
along with the rain

369
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,700
danced to the beating
of sweet fingen.

370
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,800
The magic bird, the
lightning and the fish

371
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
spread light and gave us
flowen of the night.

372
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Let's solve the puzzle
of eveyone's stoy.

373
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,300
Let's change the
tactics of our game.

374
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,300
Experience is my teacher.
Let's learn from them and win.

375
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,700
Let's sing another song, march
like soldien and spread laughter.

376
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,700
Let's rock! Let's
stir things up!

377
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,100
Let's fly high!

378
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:28,100
Let's fight and fly higher
with the wind of change

379
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,100
Oh, dream that was nurtured
for days, stand by my side.

380
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,900
ls yourwheel pulling
you to the side?

381
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,100
- Look Chief! Bar!
- Oh, shall we go get some lemon juice?

382
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,600
- Don't waste time.
- Waste time?

383
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,100
lt is said, that you can't
get back time lost.

384
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,700
But a_er an 18 hour flight to the US,
you land on the same day you started.

385
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:00,800
- Let's go. - You want to start now?
There's alcohol on the flight!

386
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Those are the main fireworks.
These are samples.

387
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,500
Lets drink before and
during the trip.

388
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,500
Should l get rid ofthem?

389
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,000
What are you looking at?

390
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,400
There is a big secret that l
haven't told you till now.

391
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
What secret is that?

392
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,100
Don't keep us in suspense.

393
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,400
- Tell us.
- When l was young...

394
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,200
- l was in love with a girl. Jessi.
- Who? - Jessi

395
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,800
Love was her weakness.

396
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,700
She loved me so much.

397
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,200
She also loved a filmmaker next
door as much as she loved me

398
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,100
and then she eloped with another
guy who was another neighbor.

399
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,500
But before she le_...

400
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,600
- She made me promise something.
- What promise?

401
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,100
That l would consider all Indians
as my brothen and sisters.

402
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,700
A promise might be nothing for her.
But for me,

403
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:53,700
l find it di_icult enough to break
an egg, let alone a promise.

404
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,100
And because Indians are my brothers and
sisters... l can't even date or mary one!

405
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,700
- Did you hear what he said?
- Forget about it...

406
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,600
A_er all, no Indian woman
could match you. True?

407
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,900
- Hey...
- What?

408
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,100
We'll find an American girl with
golden hair, co_ee brown eyes

409
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:26,800
and red lips, carying a lamp, and
who'll walk so_ly into your house.

410
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,100
We'll make sure that happens.

411
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:33,600
- He needs 'pleasure' in his life too.
- What?

412
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,200
- You mean 'marriage' in life?
- Yes. Kids. Family and responsibilities.

413
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Listen, within a year

414
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,900
there'll be kids running
around your house.

415
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,900
- That's right.
- Come on.

416
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,100
The air hostesses will
be beautiful right?

417
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,600
Are they the ones we
saw in skirts?

418
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Let go of me.

419
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,300
- It's because l'm scared. - Ifyou're
scared, you shouldn't have come.

420
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Welcome.

421
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
- She's wearing a sari.
- l'm not coming.

422
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
l know.

423
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,900
- l am Jabbar Pottakuzhi. Actually...
- Come here.

424
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,200
Are we on the wrong flight?
See, an African air hostess.

425
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
What's wrong with you guys?

426
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,900
This is my ticket.

427
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,700
- Can't we sit here?
- Sit there. Sit.

428
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,300
He put it in his mouth.

429
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Did you see this. He's
making fun of me.

430
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,400
Don't laugh at me.

431
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,900
l'll get o_the flight.

432
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,800
Be quiet or they'll ask you to leave
the flight. They're notorious for it!

433
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800
What's this old lady saying?

434
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,300
She's telling us what to
do ifthe plane crashes.

435
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,800
What? Don't scare me.

436
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,000
l'm already sitting
here frightened.

437
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
lt's like giving a discount
card for the mortuay

438
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,400
to patients going into
the operating theater.

439
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,200
The liquor is here. Miss, two
double brandies and soda for me.

440
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
- Miss...
- Whisky.

441
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,200
ls there any le_?

442
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,900
- Enjoy your drink.
- Thank you.

443
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,000
Two double brandies for me.
Two double brandies.

444
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,800
We can get as much as we
want in fint class, right?

445
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Don't gulp it like it's water.

446
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,800
- This is fine stuff. Show it
some respect. - Will l get more?

447
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,900
Miss, one more please.

448
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Here, don't you want the glass?

449
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,300
Don't be greedy. What will
that air hostess think?

450
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,100
Air hostess? They were air hostesses 20
years ago. Now they are air grannies.

451
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
lnstead offlirting with them,
l'd rather drink and pass out.

452
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,200
-Am l not right?
- Be quiet. Don't make so much noise.

453
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,500
- If you are quiet, they'll give you a
Iot of liquor. - Dude, check her out.

454
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,200
They touched my entire body
at the security check.

455
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,900
Varkie didn't you tell
me there are gays here?

456
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,100
l thinkthey were. Lucky for me,
l put on underwear today.

457
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,200
- Finally you listen to me.
- Leave it...

458
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,100
They don't know that Jabbar
Pottakuzhi is a VIP.

459
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,200
Nobody is safe. They even frisked our
ex-president when he visited last year.

460
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Do something.
Start a protest now.

461
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,000
- Protest? As if he'll do it.
- What? They spoke to me in English.

462
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,100
lf it had been our language, l'd
have given them a mouthful.

463
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,600
- Yeah, right! - Didn't l protest
in our local railway station?

464
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,100
- This isAmerica.
- Shut up.

465
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,900
Let's see how we can find Sunny.

466
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Let's use the pass
phrase spies used to use.

467
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,000
- It rains in Moscow this time ofyear.
- It rains in Moscow this time of year.

468
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,000
- It rains in Moscow this time ofyear.
- It rains in Moscow this time of year.

469
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,200
lt rains in Moscow this time ofyear.

470
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,000
lt rains in Moscow this time of year.

471
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
But not in Prague.

472
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,500
- Hi. l'm Sunny.
-Jaganathan.

473
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,400
- Welcome to America.
- He looks like a Bollywood actor.

474
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
- This is Jabbar. - Hi Mr. Jabbar.
- This is Varkie.

475
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,500
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello Va_ie. Come on let's go.

476
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,300
Look. A train driving on the road.

477
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,900
That's a car. A limousine

478
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
This is why l ask you to
watch English movies.

479
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,000
He watches English movies. But they
don't have can and bikes in them.

480
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,500
Some ofthem don't
even have sound.

481
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,000
Don't make fun of me.

482
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,300
- That's my weakness.
- Get in.

483
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,900
What si_ Is this your
house or your ca_

484
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,200
You're funny Jaganathan.

485
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Either l should do comedy or action.
That's what they like.

486
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
- Yes.
- So...

487
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,900
- How was the flight?
- Ok.

488
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,200
The flight was good but
they gave us rabbit food.

489
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:38,500
We can fix that. There is a nice Italian
restaurant in the hotel you're staying.

490
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They have great pasta.

491
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,900
My tongue has been dead for the
past days eating lettuce leaves.

492
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,400
lf l have pasta now l'll have
to place a wreath on it.

493
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,000
Can you arrange for a
little rice and fish cury?

494
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Otherwise l reckon l'll be
dropping rabbit poo tomorrow.

495
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,500
- l'll do one thing. l'll ask my wife
to make it for you. - That's great!

496
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Sir, do they have
liquor shops here?

497
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,300
... and do they stand
in line there?

498
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
What's this?

499
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,400
This is a Rubik's cube.
My stress reliever.

500
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,000
- What?
- l use it when l'm stressed.

501
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,000
When l was in tenth grade l
heard of a cube in mathematics.

502
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,400
ls it that?

503
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,300
l've heard of cube too.

504
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:18,500
l know. Ice cube.

505
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,500
lce cube! We find it in the ice
factoy and it's used in the bar.

506
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,200
lsn't the building Bin
Laden knocked down here?

507
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,600
Bin Laden... Stop your nonsense.

508
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,600
These women are gorgeous...
such eye candy!

509
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,600
Stare gracefully.
Stare gracefully.

510
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,000
- You guys stay here, l'll be
back in five minutes. - What?

511
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,200
- l'll be back in no time. Five minutes.
- We'll just look around.

512
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,800
- Varkie. That's an awesome figure.
- Just come along.

513
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,600
Ah. Emerging Kerala.

514
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,700
- Hello.
- What did l ever do to you..

515
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,100
to give me such trouble?

516
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,300
- What happened?
- You're asking me what happened?

517
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,700
This is like county bums going into the
city. They're creating a scene here.

518
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,500
Are these guys supposed
to help us win?

519
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,100
That's iust appearances.

520
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Jaganathan is cleverwith
pe_ect political acumen.

521
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
And the othertwo with him;

522
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,700
behind big people you always
find dumb people like them.

523
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,400
He's just a little short tempered
otherwise, he's a nice man.

524
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,300
Eveything will be alright.
You'll see.

525
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:52,300
- Things will get better.
- l hope they do.

526
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,800
This is like adding
fuel to the fire.

527
00:44:59,600 --> 00:44:59,600
l've heard trouble
finds you in many ways.

528
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:01,600
But this time it's
come by plane.

529
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,700
America!

530
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,100
Wow, sex!

531
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,800
The last sheet is also gone.

532
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,500
These people only have paper here. How
will l write a complaint without a pen?

533
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,400
l have to complain that
there's no water.

534
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,400
Allah. God. This is bad.

535
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,800
l have to get a big bucket
and a mug tomorrow.

536
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,900
Wine glass?

537
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,600
America. WhatAmerica?

538
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:56,800
There's no water in the toilet.

539
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,400
Wait and watch, l'll leave
behind halfthe glass ofwater.

540
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:23,900
My name is

541
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,900
Sudhi!

542
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Your name is Meenu Kum!

543
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,900
Sudhi!

544
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,100
Meenu Kutty!

545
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:34,200
Sudhi!

546
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,200
Meenu Kutty!

547
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:38,200
Tell me the vowels.

548
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,200
- Mammal?
- No, no, no, no.

549
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,200
- Vowels!
- Oh!

550
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,700
Co_ee?

551
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,600
What's your name?

552
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,900
- What's your name?
- Lisa.

553
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,200
- Pi_a, good name.
- No, no, Lisa.

554
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,300
l've heard of Monalisa.
No no lisa?

555
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,800
l'm poor English.

556
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,600
Oh. Paul English. Nice name.

557
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,700
Not my name. My
name is Jaganathan.

558
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,800
Chacko Nathan?

559
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,500
Not Chacko Nathan. Ja - Gan - Na - Than

560
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
Sory...
Excuse me.

561
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,000
America is definitely user friendly.

562
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,500
To answer her call
she asks to be excuse! d.

563
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,600
- Jagan.
- l'm here.

564
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,300
You're not ready yet?

565
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,900
John is waiting for our meeting.

566
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,900
- Ready.
- Wearing a shirt and dhoti?

567
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,700
l'm comfortable in this.
Plenty of room for fresh air.

568
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,300
lf l wear a suit and tie, it's
like someone's choking me.

569
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,500
- How do l look?
- Super, right?

570
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,800
Before you couldn't a_ord
dhotis and now look at you!

571
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,500
Didn't l tell you yesterday? You
have to be in suit for a meeting with John.

572
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:57,600
l don't want to...

573
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,900
- No. - You'll look great in a suit.
- No way.

574
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,500
You tell him.

575
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,900
You must wear a suit in America.

576
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,800
- We'll fix this.
- It's time to go.

577
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
l told you that dress code
is vey important here.

578
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
- The glasses are great.
- Listen to me.

579
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,500
See. You people do
not value me.

580
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:40,700
But these people dressed in suits and ties
have called me for a problem they can't solve.

581
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,600
You're great!

582
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,600
Hi Sunny. Good morning.
What's up?

583
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,200
He's our PR and marketing guru.
Second in command, Andy.

584
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:56,300
Hello.

00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,600
- Undee? Underwear?
- Excuse me. My full name is Sachidanandan.

586
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,500
How did you change
that kind of a name?

587
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,100
O_icially, l'm Sachidanandan.

588
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,800
When l was doing my MBA
my friends called me Anand.

589
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
When l started working with
Sunny, it became Andy.

590
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,700
Different decorations
in di_erent countries.

591
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,600
There's nothing wrong
in decorating yourself

592
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,700
as long as you know
who the real you is.

593
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,200

l got the chance.

594
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,200

- Come.

595

lt's such a pleasure to meet you. Sunny
has told me eveything about you.

602
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,600

Sunny has told me all about you.

We're going to create
histoy together.

605
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,600
You and l are going to make the
most ofwhat we've got here.

606
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:25,300
l'm a modest man and you
can help me make it.

607
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,800
- Did you understand what he said?
- No.

608
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Well...

609
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Ok...

610
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,100
We came just because Sunny told me.
We are notjobless people from India.

611
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,600
lfyou want to know about us,
you can go there and inquire.

612
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,900
We'll fix eveything for you.

613
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,100
You talk him. He talk me.
How is it?

614
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,100
l'll explain to you later.

615
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,300
Oops! My phone! Excuse me!
Excuse me!

616
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,500
Ok, ok.

617
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,200
Why is he blabbering in English like an
Australian captain who's won the toss.

618
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,900
Any problems?

619
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,800
No no. Only solution. Solution.

620
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,100
ln a minute, he spoke the amount
of English that l speak in a year.

621
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:39,700
Can you guys stay out for mo minutes.
l'll just speak to John and come back.

622
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,900
Now l get it.

623
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,000
Bush.

624
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
- With him? Bush?
- Oh Bush!

625
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,900
The doors... push. Come on.

626
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,700
No phone calls.
Just take messages.

627
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,100
l first want to know about
the elections here.

628
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:05,200
The governofs post is generally given to
physically challenged people in our county.

629
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:09,400
They have elections for that here?

630
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

631
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,300
Well actually. The governor here is like
the chief minister back in our county.

632
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,400
So, the chief minister
of Kerala is...

633
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,800
...is the governor here.

634
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,100
So the governor here
is the chief minister there?

635
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,300
Let me come to the point.

636
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,600
There are only mo parties here.

637
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,200
Republicans and Democrats.

638
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,900
We are Republicans.

639
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,300
Which is indicated
by the red spots.

640
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,700
Currently there are more
blue spots than red spots.

641
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,100
lt's because the counties favoring
us, in your language 'districts',

642
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,800
are vey few.

643
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,200
The reason? Our candidate is John Koy
and his public rating is vey bad.

644
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,700
Our objective is to increase the number of
these red spots. That's why you're here.

645
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,900
Excuse me.

646
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:56,900
You brought our boss
here for such a silly thing?

647
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,900
Get some red stickers and put them
overthe blue ones. Problem solved.

648
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,200
Brilliant.

649
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,400
- Koy's rating will rise.
- No, it won't!

650
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Who is John Koy's opponent?

651
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Who is it?

652
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,100
lt's a guy called George Hope.

653
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,300
Who?

654
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,300
Any solutions?

655
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,000
He looks like our
Iocal builder

656
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,400
with those glasses
and that gray moustache.

657
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:27,400
You first need a problem
to solve to gain votes.

658
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,100
A good politician is one
who solves a problem.

659
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,000
Let's start with a problem
that always works in India.

660
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Caste.

661
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,400
We don't have any issues like that.
Where is caste in the States?

662
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,500
ls there a county
without caste issues?

663
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,000
Historically there have been many
problems between blacks and whites.

664
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,800
- Now there's less of a problem.
- That's enough.

665
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,300
- Blood comes out easily from
unhealed wounds.- Yeah, yeah.

666
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,400
Assuming we execute your idea,
how do you plan to implement it?

667
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,700
l can give you any
number of ideas.

668
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,700
But the consequences
ofwhat we do

669
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,000
should land on opponent
George Hope's head.

670
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,100
Right now we have reports from Compton of
race riots, bemeen whites and blacks...

671
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,400
over a whole bunch of issues we're
not getting a clear account of.

672
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,000
We're going to go live now to John Koy on the
scene bringing both these communities
together.

673
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:24,400
Let me say this. There's no place
for racial disharmony in my county.

674
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,700
We are all brothers, and
if you are girl, sisters.

675
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:35,700
Like the keys on my piano keyboard.
We play the tunes together.

676
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,600
Bobby Marley. One
of my favorites.

677
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,200
- Cheers.
- My glass didn't clink.

678
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,600
Congrats Jagan. Koy
is a happy man.

679
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,300
Our ratings have gone above
Hope's for the fint time.

680
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,300
When our boss places his hand on
something, the rest is histoy.

681
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,400
Not only in America. Human
beings are same eveywhere.

682
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:01,100
ln evey group, they only point
out mistakes in others.

683
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,200
Religion, caste, language.

684
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,500
A whole lot of
unnecessay things.

685
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,400
Sir, when the boss is drunk
he talks philosophy.

686
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,700
l just said that because
l got the chance.

687
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,200
My beautiful girl, l haven't
seen you for a day.

688
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,500
Disappointed...

689
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,500
How is eveything?

690
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,800
- Hey beautiful, what's your name?
- Kimberly

691
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,100
- What did she say?
- Kaarthumbi.

692
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,600
Will you mary me? You will be the
Princess of Kerala, God's Own County.

693
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,100
l'm sory. l have a
partner already.

694
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,500
Who is that snow white?

695
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:12,300
Match has been
abandoned due to rain.

696
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,400
lt's okJagan.
She's a lesbian.

697
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,200
- FBl?
- Not FBl. Lesbian.

698
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,400
Which means she's
attracted to women.

699
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,300
lf all the beautiful girls
are attracted to other girls...

700
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,500
what will the men do?

701
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,800
That is why they don't
bother to look at us.

702
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,100
- Ok. l'm making a move.
- Give it here. l'll deal with this.

703
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,100
Don't wory.

704
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:39,100
- We'll come when it gets a little
darker. - Us too.

705
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
You leave, Sir.

706
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:42,900
Ok take care guys.

707
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,800
- Be safe.
- Take care.

708
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,800
Boss! Boss!

709
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,100
Please...

710
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,800
Happy days in America.

711
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,400
Your eating and drinking
is going well.

712
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,600
Yes. It's going well.

713
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,700
l asked you to set me up
with an American girl

714
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,400
and you still leave me
hung - hung - hungy.

715
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,300
l blame myselffor giving you
guys this responsibility.

716
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,300
Boss. The fair ladies' hair
here is like coconut husks.

717
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,900
But, the hair ofthe
women in our county...

718
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:43,400
Wouldn't it be kicking ifyou saw them with
flowers in their oiled hair like our girls?

719
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,600
-A promise might be nothing foryou.
But for me...- Please...

720
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,400
- We've heard a lot of this.
- Can you stop it?

721
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:53,300
Who put this post here?
Who put this post here?

722
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,400
lsn't this that guy?
Vasco de Gama

723
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,400
- The guy we know. Vasco de Gama.
- l'll give Vasco de Gama some trouble.

724
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:03,300
No, Boss! Don't piss here!
This is America!

725
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,200
- Don't people piss in America?
- Not in public places.

726
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,300
- Dude, he's drunk.
- Yeah, he's totally wasted.

727
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:17,400
Let's call a taxi and take him home. Unless you
want to eat breakfast in an American prison.

728
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,700
Then call a taxi.

729
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,300
Hey bro, you have a lot of
admirals in Kerala.

730
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:22,700
-Admiren, not admirals! - Yes
you have many admirers.

731
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,400
Please wait here. Don't go anywhere.

732
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:28,800
Come on. Let's
get a taxi. Taxi!

733
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,500
Call a taxi. Taxi!

734
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:51,900
1 ,OOO dollan? We are Indians.
Poor. 750 ok?

735
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
- No.
- Hey. Please, please, please...

736
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,900
750 ok?

737
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,900
Any promotional o_ers
for new customers?

738
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,900
- 750 ok?
- Please. Accept.

739
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,300
When brother is here, you should consider
your sister-in-law as your mother.

740
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:15,300
750 ok? Please, please

741
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:17,300
Please, please, please.

742
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,300
- Please. Ok?
- Ok.

743
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,000
What a handsome beast!!!

744
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,100
You didn't introduce me to them.

745
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,000
- What?
- You didn't introduce me to them.

746
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:49,400
l said...

747
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,100
l'm his political assistant.

748
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:53,400
Ok, and him?

749
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,500
He's his plain assistant.

750
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,400
-We came in a plane.
- l didn't say that.

751
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,500
Jabbar Pottakuzhi. Come on.
How old are you?

752
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,500
Varkie. Varkie.

753
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,900
- Come here.
- The Boss is calling you. Go.

754
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
Go sit there.

755
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,100
Was it for this?

756
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:11,200
You're the political assistant,
you can sit on the floor.

757
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,800
Talk.

758
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Boss.

759
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,600
What's your name?

760
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,600
My name is Jessi.

761
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,200
- Boss. What happened?
- Jessi.

762
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,200
- Jessi.
- Oh Jessi.

763
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:35,200
- What's the matte_
- No... One...

764
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,200
One matter name is Jessi.

765
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,700
That's the only matter.

766
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,000
- But nice name.
- Thank you.

767
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,100
- Lovely smile.
- Ya, ya.

768
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,100
By the way, what's your name?

769
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,900
My name is Jaganathan.
Call me Jaggu.

770
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,800
- Jaganathan.
- Oh...

771
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,000
Can l call you Jacks?

772
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,800
- Jacks? Yeah. That's a dog's name.
- Jacky.

773
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,200
Jacky. Jacky, the giant killer!

774
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,700
- Why this bad, bad, things you're...
- Tell.

775
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,700
Basically l'm from
a poor family.

776
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,200
My husband, he ran away from me.

777
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,500
l've a child, lot
of debts and...

778
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,700
that's the reason l
am into all this.

779
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,200
Boss. What is she saying?

780
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:24,500
She said her husband le_ her
and went with someone else.

781
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,500
All ofthem have
the same resume!

782
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,000
Poor girl. She does
not know anything.

783
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,100
750 multiplied by 30.

784
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Ok...

785
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,400
750 by thim.

786
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,200
l give payment for one month.
l book you.

787
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,800
You have only one iob.

788
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,800
Love me. Romance.

789
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,200
But no outgoing!

790
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:56,800
- Yeah. No going.
- Ok, love me...

791
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:01,700
l pay dollan. You give romance.

792
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,900
- Sure, but...
- No...

793
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,600
No butt...

794
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,000
l want only heart.

795
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Please.

796
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,700
l've heard of love
at first sight...

797
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
According to the boss, it's
Iove eveything at sight.

798
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,800
He's got an award from the
Indian president for this thing.

799
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:23,100
The clouds get denser
Desires start to pour

800
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,600
and l hear a new melody in my heart.

801
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:36,000
With whom should we begin ourjourney?
With whom should we share our pain?

802
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,000
With whom should we share our life?
You never know.

803
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You never know.

804
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You never know.

805
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,900
Ok great. Our campaign
is gaining momentum now.

806
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,000
lfwe maintain this,
we're sure to win.

807
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,900
- Ok let's move to the next project.
- What is it?

808
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,200
We have to give
people some freebies.

809
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:06,100
Proiect ''Free''.

810
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,200
How about a TV?

811
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:11,000
TV? Don't you read the
papers back home?

812
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:14,300
They give TVs, fridges, and washing
machines for free in the elections there.

813
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:17,700
According to American
standards, you should

814
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,100
give them at least a
Range Rover or a Humvee.

815
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,400
Or else, let it be a free trip to the moon.
That's the fashion now.

816
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,200
We have to win. But aren't these
cheap, silly, and shameless things?

817
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:34,300
Are you Mr Pemect? Ifyou are
ashamed, you shouldn't be in this.

818
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:38,600
The end is important, not the means.
That's how it is in our county!

819
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,400
Send this man out.

820
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:43,400
He's talking nonsense when the boss
is saying something important.

821
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,700
- Creating an idea is not easy.
-Andy...

822
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,000
- Let me handle this.
-Are you sure? - Yeah...

823
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,900
- Mr Pe_ect.
- Idiots.

824
01:07:59,400 --> 01:07:59,400
- Sunny these guys will ruin you.

825
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,300
- Get lost man.
- Did he abuse us in English?

826
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,800
Boss, he's gone.

827
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,200
- l'm fine. Bit expensive.
- Ok.

828
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:09,300
We'll have to spend plenty.

829
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:16,400
Let's win first. l'll teach you how
to earn this money back in mo weeks.

830
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,400
But l'll need extra commission forthat.
In dollars.

831
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:27,300
l really like to think of ourselves
as compassionate Republicans.

832
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,900
We give iPods, iPhones,
automobiles to various people...

833
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,000
and in return, they'll make
money for this county.

834
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:36,400
lf you do not want this
county to succeed...

835
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,400
you are not a patriot. You
are not a true American.

836
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,100
This is an outrage.
He can't do that.

837
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh yeah. All the way to
election day they can do it.

838
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:58,300
lnstead of bringing India up
to American standards,

839
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,000
You're bringing America
down to Indian standards.

840
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,000
l'm done with this farce.

841
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,100
Ok...

842
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,500
Now l realize where all the
rice in our county goes...

843
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,600
They eat so much, but
still look like liards.

844
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,300
Jacks. Stop talking in Indian language.
l don't understand at all.

845
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,100
When you listen to the word 'lndia',
your heart should feel proud.

846
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,000
When you listen to the word 'Kerala',
your soul should swell.

847
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,100
Do you understand?
Obviously not.

848
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,100
You are really funny.

849
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,100
Welcome. Welcome. Namaste.

850
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:01,900
Oh. Hindi speaking Chinese.
Namaste.

851
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,900
- You wanna look at this?
- Yeah.

852
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,900
iPhone. Good choice. See this?

853
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,900
No, no. Don't wory.

854
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,300
This is what you want.

855
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,900
Duplicate.

856
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,000
See! Super strong!

857
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Like you.

858
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,600
- Thank you. - But Jacks these
things have no warranty at all.

859
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
But life itself has no warranty.

860
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:35,000
Duplicate shop. But
great philosophy.

861
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,400
l like you...

862
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,400
Give me anything...

863
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,400
- l'll make a duplicate.
- Ok...

864
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,200
Make a duplicate ofthis girl.
Jessi.

865
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Huh? Jacks!

866
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
You know what? l really like you.

867
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,100
- Let me show you something.
- Ok.

868
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,200
Jacks we have to go somewhere.

869
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,200
- Jacks no, listen to me.
- Come on.

870
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:58,000
Why are you doing this Jacks.
Jacks let's go, no?

871
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,700
- My uncle.
- Your uncle?

872
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Jackie Chan, his uncle? These guys are
betterthan us when it comes to lying.

873
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:17,800
- It's notjust all rugs.
- Ok. - Not bad.

874
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,300
- Don'tjudge a book by its cover.
- What's that?

875
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,300
Duplicate. What's your name?
What's your name?

876
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,500
- Call me Dupe Lee.
- Dupe Lee?

877
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,300
- Ok. Thank you Dupe Lee. - You're
welcome.

878
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,300
- Bye. - l'll see you later.

879
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,800
Now thatAndy has joined George Hope's
campaign, we have to be more careful.

880
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:40,600
Why? Anyway, now that he's gone there,
l'm sure they'll lose.

881
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,600
lt's my wife. She's invited
you all for dinner.

882
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:51,400
Has she? In that
case l want pi_a.

883
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:51,500
- Burgerfor me.- Burger? In that case,
burger for me too. It tastes good.

884
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,100
You've been here just a few days
and you've already become American?

885
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,200
No wonder people from Kerala don't
return when they come here.

886
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,200
lt's disappointing. Sunny, in
that case l'll have burger too.

887
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:11,400
l ordered burger, piza, hot dogs, and some
bread with meat, in our hotel room yesterday

888
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,300
l've named this
sticker girl, ''Spom''.

889
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,500
Excuse me guys.

890
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,600
l don't know ifyou understand
the seriousness of this.

891
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,100
l've lost my right hand, Andy.

892
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,400
And there's less than 150/o chance
ofwinning now. It's not a joke anymore.

893
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Out ofthe ideas you've come
up with, one ofthem flopped.

894
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,900
When you guys go after
girls like Jessi and Nancy,

895
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,600
it's my campaign
money that's being lost.

896
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,400
Which is the group that
supports John the least?

897
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,500
African Americans.

898
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,200
They don't like John.

899
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,300
- Boss those dark guys?
-As if you are fair and handsome.

900
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:04,300
- What kind of stu_ do they like?
- Music. Rap Music.

901
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,400
ln that case get a famous raper.

902
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,900
- Rapper.
- That's what l meant.

903
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,600
Get a few rappers
and make a show.

904
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,400
Let John Koy present it!

905
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:18,200
Then, just like the
politicians in our county,

906
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,600
he'll have to hug children with runny
noses, kiss old people, show some love,

907
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,700
and then dance
to the beat of their songs.

908
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:29,300
John is not interested in rap.

909
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,800
You have to act ifyou are politician.
Make him understand.

910
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,500
How will you organize this? How will
you get these people in?

911
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,600
ln Kerala, just some food
and liquor would work.

912
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,400
Here, it's beer and pi_a.

913
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,500
Seems like an expensive deal!

914
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,800
We lose money today. But
we sweep it up tomorrow.

915
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,900
Politics is an investment.

916
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,600
Two languages on this?

917
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,000
English and Spanish.

918
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,400
What's the percentage
of Spanish people here?

919
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:53,400
About 30 percent. But most
ofthem are illegal.

920
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,800
A good percentage ofthem
don't have voting rights.

921
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,800
Give me eveything.

922
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,300
Please buy me some black paint.

No, no Spanish! Only English!

925
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You're holding the
board upside down.

926
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,400
No, no Spanish! Only English!
Only English!

927
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:36,500
- Hey you wanna go for a ride?
- Go

928
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,500
- How much for you?
- Just go

929
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,500
Damn, you fine!

930
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
Yeah!

931
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,600
Let's increase the momentum.
Let's move it fast.

932
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,400
- What?
- l asked you to step it up a gear.

933
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:51,700
l almost forgot. What's the point in having
elections without fasting and lemon juice.

Proiect ''Hunger Strike''.

Jaganathan. Jaganathan

936
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,700
ln America the minimum age
for voting is 18 right?

937
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,100
So college students can vote.

938
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:02,100
Yes...

939
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:07,500
Do something. Announce that we will
waiver all education loans if we win.

940
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,700
Also give a beer allowance
to all students.

Proiect ''Youth''.

942
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,900
Free education today is key.

943
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:20,600
We want the young men oftoday to
study hard and become doctors...

944
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:26,100
..we want the young women to study hard and
become nurses and high powered secretaries.

945
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,700
And we want them
to have free beer.

946
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,800
Why? Well ifthey are wo_ing
so hard,

947
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,600
they deserve to relax
a little a_er wo_.

948
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:23,700
Political analyMrs view Jaganathan
as the new young prospect for Kerala.

949
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,000
Hello. No, no, no.

950
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,600
Sir is in a meeting with the
Mineral Beach Sand Miners.

951
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,300
Don't you undentand?
Call tomorrow.

952
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,800
Sir? Why are you
sitting like this?

953
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,800
Why are you still
drinking and not in bed?

954
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,100
l can't sleep now!

955
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,100
What's the time in America now?

956
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:41,200
Whatever time it is in America,
Jaganathan's time is now.

957
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:45,200
When l ask the time in America,
you don't have to talk about Jaganathan.

958
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,100
- Is it morning there now?
- Yes

959
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,100
ln that case l want a soda.

960
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,000
- Soda is right here.
- It's flat.

961
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:55,900
How can you tell by
just looking at it?

962
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,000
- It's not cold.
- Not cold?

963
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,900
- Did it burn you?
- It's freezing!

964
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,500
Not enough. l want it colder.
Go get me some cold soda.

965
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:08,600
He's angy at me because of
Jaganathan's success.

966
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,100
l've told him many times
not to treat me like this.

967
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,300
- Hello.
- Hello Sunny.

968
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,900
This is Francis Kuniappan.

969
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:19,200
Ah. What's new?

970
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:22,800
Don't listen to Jaganathan.

971
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,700
All his ideas are cheap.

972
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,200
Send him back.

973
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,900
There aren't too
many problems here now.

974
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:34,000
He's tying a lot of gimmicks.
Luckily, things are working out.

975
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,100
Why do you have him there
and take such a risk?

976
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,300
lfyou have him there, you
will face more problems.

977
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,800
l'm in the middle of
a big presentation.

978
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,400
l took the call just because it was you.
l'll call you as soon as this is over.

979

Soda.

983
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,100
Soda.

984
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,900
When l asked for a cold soda...

985
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,900
l didn't mean soda
from the Himalayas.

986
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,700
This is arrogance. Don't
ty to be a smartass.

987
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,800
What ever cold l give you,
l get hot words in return.

988
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,400
- l know it's because you envy Jaganathan.
- What did you say now?

989
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,800
Did you say that you
know eveything?

990
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,100
Are you playing with me?

Are you okay? Jamie!

999
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Oh, little bird. Oh, lady love

1000
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,100
You sing your beautiful
melody so_ly in my ears.

1001
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:29,900
Young branches are searching
for fresh flowen again

1002
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:37,900
Oh adorable breeze, you are
as beautiful as silk

1003
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:48,100
Oh naughty breeM, as you caress my body

1004
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:55,600
What can l do this moment?
What can l do?

1005
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,500
Would you tell me?
What can l do?

1006

Are you coming my way again?

1009
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,300
Oh heart, are you by my side?

1010
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,300
Or are you swinging to his side?

1011
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:02,600
ls this magic?
Is this the season of flowen?

1012
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:08,500
ls this the chill lightning, the breeM,
or the downpour of the moonlight?

1013
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,400
ls this a dream?
Is this just a delusion?

1014
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:18,000
ls this the rainbow that will vanish soon?

1015
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:27,200
What can l do? What can l do?
Would you tell me? What can l do?

1017

1018
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,400

1020
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,300
We've got a problem.

01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,300
And it's a big one.

1022
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:39,100
OurJohn Koy was with a girl.

1023

1025
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:58,300
This hanky panky is a weakness
with politicians in all countries?

1026
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:03,200
We've spent some money and
got most of the copies,

1027

but the master copy is with George Hope.

1028

He'll give it to the
media tomorrow morning.

1029
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:17,700
Just when l think it's plain
sailing, there's a storm brewing.

1030
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:22,200
l never thought this apple pie

Ok...

Let's do the same we do in India.

1035
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,200
Tell them it's all
computer graphics.

1036
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,800
That won't
wo_ in America.

1037
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,800
The media will stirthis thing up.

1038
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,200
You sure there aren't
any other copies around?

1039
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,200
Sure. A hundred percent sure.

1040
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,200
Ok. l'll find a way.

1041
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,500
What's your plan?

1042
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,300
Let's keep it a surprise.

1043
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,800
That way, there'll be
a kick when it all unfolds.

01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,300
Don't make a sound.

1055

- Boss, stop. We'll slip him a few
dollars and send him o_. - Shut up.

1070
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:58,300
See there are a whole
Iot of other vehicles now.

1071
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,900
There's a car behind.

1072
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:04,900
Brake!

1073
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:13,500
Drive faster, Boss. It's a big car!
Why're you driving so slowly?

1074
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,700
No matter how big the car is, how
can l drive if we're out of gas?

1075
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,700
No gas? See, the
yellow light is on!

1076
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,900
Great! We're out of gas
in a serious car chase!

1077
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,300
How can l be part of a serious car
chase with comedians like you?

1078
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,400
l should've stayed a villain.

1079
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,500
Boss, ifyou have a plastic bottle
l'll go get some gas.

1080

You handle the car and the cops.
You know Sunny's number, right?

1081
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,700
Boss.

1082

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

- How do you recogniM me?
- That's a silly question.

1087
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,400
Are there people from Kerala
who don't know you?

1088
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,000
You're all over
the newspapers.

1089
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,900
But... why are you dressed like this?

1090
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
l'll tell you later.

1091
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,700
The cops are after me.

1092
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,700
- Cops?

l want to show it to my wife.

1098
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,500
She likes you more than she likes me.

1099
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,700
Ok.

Oh. Superman!

1103
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,700
Superman from Kerala.

1104
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,900
l'm not Superman, l'm Badman!

1105
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,200
Boss, it's me, Varkie.

1106
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,700
- Do you recognize me?
- No...

1107
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:45,000
This is Jabbar. We went into Keshavan
Nair's shop too; just like you did.

1108
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,800
He likes you so much that he
gave us these costumes.

1109

We came here to help you.

1110
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,800
Why're you guys hassling me?

1111
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,200
Not a sound. Come on.

1112
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,900
Boss, why are we here?

1113
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,800
Have we come here to steal?

1114
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,000
Steal all the CDs and
DVDs from this house.

1115
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,700
George has a secret
video of John.

1116
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,000
- A secret video?

1121
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:17,900
You go that way.
Don't come with me.

1122
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,700
Let's get it before the boss comes.

1123
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,100
- Be careful. - l hope l get to
see something juicy on the CD.

1124
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,200
Careful.

1125
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,000
You'll be electrocuted
ifyou touch it.

1126
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,400
Careful.

1127
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:13,800
A rat?!

1128
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:17,200
Just a moment!

1129
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,100
Gotta get rid of it now!

1130

Go down.

1134
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,200
Almost there; a little more.

1135

Brother! Watch out!

1136

No laser security?

1142

-All this hard work for nothing.
Here you go. - Thank you.

1143

True. And what stamina!!!

1158
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,900
You should've heard how they

1159
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,400
Right! l had a real tantrum. l

Anyway, thank you so much guys.

1161
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:37,600

- Fund.
- Oh. Fund. Fund.

1166
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:52,400
The idea is to raise funds
for the election campaign.

1167
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,200
There's fund raising here too?

1168
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,900
- What else happens there?
- Food and drink,

1169
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,900
and also John's speech.

1170
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,500
God only knows how
much we'll raise.

1171
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:01,600
Are you only going to
provide food and drink?

1172
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Why not ty something different?

1173
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,800
l obviously can't have
dancing girls there!

1174
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:08,400
No, it's clever. John's speech
is going to be boring, yes?

1175
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Are you serious?

1176
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,100

01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,200
God and Cinema.

1179
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,600
How will l get hot dancers
at such short notice?

1180

ls that a problem?

1181
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:25,100
All married actresses from
Kerala settle here, right?

1182
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:27,600
There's a saying, ''The
Iegs that danced, and

1183
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,000
the mouth that sang,
can never be idle.''

1184
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,800

He fell for me during the night.

1200
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,800

1223
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:39,500
even though this is
an award for politicians.

1224
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,800
lnstead this is a truly
merit based award.

1225
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:45,800
This is an award chosen by the
public who voted by text message.

1226
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,000
You're sure to get it
a_erthe dam issue.

1227
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,400
And the award goes to...

1228
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:50,700
l sent loads of texts myself.

1229
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,400
- They'll announce it now.
- Our most favorite...

1230
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,300
- MrJaganathan.
- Yes! Jaganathan!

1231
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:05,900
As Jaganathan is abroad,
his close friend,

1232
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:10,300
the King Maker,
Francis Kunjappan,

1233
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:15,000
will collect the
award on his behalf.

1234
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,600
To present the award may l welcome to the
stage,
Honorable Chief Minister Mr Thomas Joseph,

1235
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,700
and from our sponson,
Oris, Mr Haafis.

1236
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,600
Give them a big hand,
Iadies and gentlemen!

1237
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,500
lsn't he done with these
fake accounts yet?

1238
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:50,500
Sir, the president of the Party Youth Wing,
Joby Kuruvilla, is waiting outside.

1239
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,400
He's a_er a seat at
the next election.

1240
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,400
The Party Youth Wing
respects you a lot.

1241
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:04,700
That's obvious; there are
only old men around here.

1242
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,400
l'm the only one who
is young and active.

1243
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,400
They will get
expiration from me.

1244
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,400
- Inspiration.
- That's what l said. Call him.

1245
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,700
Joby!

1246
01:47:16,900 --> 01:47:18,900
- Hi Joby. Come, sit.
- Hello, Sir.

1247
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,600
lt's been ages since we met.
How are you?

1248
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,800
l'm fine. Sir, you are
the youth's ummm...

1249
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
- inspiration?
- Yes. That's right.

1250
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:29,500
- He's no genius either.
- Sir...

1251
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,800
lt is due to your e_orts that
Jaganathan's reached such a high position.

1252
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,700
Sir, you're our role model.

1253
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,100
You're our pam's King Maker.

1254
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,800
Could you possibly push my
case towards high office too?

1255
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,500
Joby, don't wory about it.
l'll take care of it. Ok?

1256
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,500
He'll push you. He'll push you.

1257
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:52,100
Kuniappan is going to help me out.

1258
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:52,200
Stupid application!

1259
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:55,200
l am fed up with these guys.

1260
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,200
Welcome.

1261
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,000
l'll take care of it.

1262
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:04,700
l'll take care ofJoby's case.

1263
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:06,700
l'll take care of it.

1264
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,400
ldiot. l can't even help
myself here.

1265
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:13,700
Let's go.

1266
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:19,500
This is like digging
your own grave.

1267
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,000
Evey newspaper is
talking about him.

1268
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Calm down.

1269
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,900
l've spent a lot of money
getting you this post.

1270
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:33,200
You'll get back double
what you spent.

1271
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:38,400
He's not grown big enough
to take my job from me.

1272
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,100
No, no, no. Don't
underestimate him.

1273
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:44,800
When he comes back
from America,

1274
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:50,200
he is going to get a King's welcome here.
Wait and see.

1275
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:52,200
King's welcome? Nonsense!

1276
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,600
Now, we have reached the
Iast phase ofthe campaign.

1277
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,100
A_erthis l can finally
sleep peacefully.

1278
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,200
But these next few days are
the most important for us.

1279
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,800
- Debates. - Debate?
- Which means?

1280
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:09,800
George and John will get an
opportunity to formally debate

1281
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,200
their manifestos and plans for
California on the same stage.

1282
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:18,000
There'll be live TV coverage.

1283
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,600
lt's make or break for
both candidates.

1284
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,600
Why do theAmericans
complicate things?

1285
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,600
Why do they put
themselves through this,

1286
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,600
just to get in and steal
from the public purse.

1287
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:34,100
Even if it's for stealing, the
politicians here accept it.

1288
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,000
He's going to talk
gibberish on stage.

1289
01:49:36,100 --> 01:49:37,800
He'd be fine if it was
all about women.

1290
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:37,900
But will he be able
to handle a rebate?

1291
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:42,300
- It's not a ''rebate''. It's a ''debate''.

1292
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,600
No worries. l have good writers who can
write first class political speeches.

1293
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:46,700
We'll make them write
a kickass speech.

1294
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:48,400
Why do we have to sweat it
when we have Holl_ood,

1295
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,100
the industy that charms
the world with cinema.

1296
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:58,800
We can get a good scriptwriter to write
an inspirational speech for John Koy.

1297
01:49:58,900 --> 01:50:01,300
ln that case, will we get the
writer ofJurassic Park?

1298
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,800
An awesome speech that
Iasts for ten minutes.

1299
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,000
Fireworks written in English.

1300
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,300
He'll get a standing ovation, even
though people won't understand a thing.

1301
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:13,900
People will fall
for his speech.

1302
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:14,600
lf it were in Kerala,
we'd know who to get.

1303
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:16,700
Yes! l know someone too.

1304
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:19,800
l get it. We'll do it.

1305
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:20,800
lfwe win this debate, your campaign
here will be successfully completed.

1306
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,500
- Dude! American style.
- Yes!

1307
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,700
- l'll transfer the money, Jagan.
- That's great.

1308
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:32,100
But help me with the
selection of writers, too.

1309
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:33,700
Help him, Boss.

1310
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,600
Ok, done!

1311
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:38,600
That's a lot.

1312
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,600
- It's just my second.
- Not that...

1313
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,300
Jaganathan's fan page
is flooded with 'Likes'.

1314
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,400
Can we steal some
and make them ours?

1315
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,400
lt's Facebook, not politics.
We can'tjust steal people.

1316
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:49,600
- They'll come to us only ifthey want.
- Make them ''Like'' us. - How?

1317
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:55,400
Bribe them with
cury and alcohol!

1318
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:59,000
Sir, this isn't a rally where we can pull
in a crowd with free food and drink.

1319
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:02,000
Youngsten will hit 'Like' only
if they feel like doing it.

1320
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:02,000
How does this work? Please
help me understand.

1321
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:07,600
You get online through a
cell phone or computer,

1322
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:11,300
and then type www.facebook.com.
A page will open.

1323
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:11,500
You use your name and email to create
a profile. That's your account.

1324
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:20,000
You can upload your pictures
and update your status there.

1325
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:25,900
When you do such things, people will
comment, like, and share your posts.

1326
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:26,000
You can also talk about things
on Twitter like Shakira does

1327
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:30,800
and loads of people
will ''Follow'' you.

1328
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,600
You can also ''Poke'' ifyou want.

1329
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,200
That's it. Do you understand?

1330
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:36,500
What did you understand?

1331
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,100
l understood that people like
me will never understand this.

1332
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,600
This is like explaining
electricity to a cat...

1333
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:49,200
Rohit's coming here next week
from central government.

1334
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Clean up the roads and put some tar
at least on the bits he'll drive on.

1335
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,700
Or else, he'll take yourjob
with him on his way back to Delhi.

1336
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,100
[in Hindi] Hello Mr. Rohit.

1337
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:15,300
[in Hindi] We welcome
you to Kerala.

1338
01:55:16,100 --> 01:55:17,700
[in Hindi] How was your Germany?

1339
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:21,300
lt's ''journey''.
Journey. Journey. Journey.

1340
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:23,600
Why this annoying Hindi?

1341
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:24,000
ls it so difficult to ask if
his journey was good in Hindi?

1342
01:55:27,700 --> 01:55:31,200
Unlike ours, Hindi is
not an easy language.

1343
01:55:32,100 --> 01:55:32,100
lf l don't impress him in Hindi, l'll
be out ifthere's a problem from Delhi.

1344
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:37,500
That's why l'm
struggling so much.

1345
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,300
[in Hindi] Hello Mr. Rohit.

1346
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:41,600
[in Hindi] We welcome
you to Kerala.

1347
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:43,100
Please come. Please come.

1348
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:47,000
Let's get in there.

1349
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:47,200
[in Hindi] Hello Mr. Rohit. We
welcome you to Kerala.

1350
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:51,700
Where's the garland?

1351
01:55:51,700 --> 01:55:51,700
Long live Rohit!

1352
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,700
Long live Rohit!

1353
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,400
There's a small problem.

1354
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:03,500
What is it?

1355
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:07,200
The usual route is out. There are
billboards ofJaganathan along the road.

1356
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:08,600
But no worries. l've
changed the route.

1357
01:56:11,300 --> 01:56:12,200
That's enough.

1358
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:15,400
Filling in potholes for
10 km all for nothing!

1359
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,600
But it's ok as long as
his photo isn't seen.

1360
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:21,200
- How's the new route?
- Full of potholes.

1361
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:25,300
Tell the driver not
to hit any big ones.

1362
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:29,800
We don't want the same problems we had when
the minister came from Delhi last time...

1363
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:31,500
Eveyone's gone. Come.

1364
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:33,200
Out the way!
Move please!

1365
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,700
Sir, you sit with him.
l'll sit in the front.

1366
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:39,300
The Chief Minister is in
the back with him. Move!

1367
01:56:39,500 --> 01:56:39,500
l'll go in the policeieep.

1368
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,800
Hello.

1369
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:48,300
[in Hindi] Hello... Yes Mummy...

1370
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:48,300
[in Hindi] Yes Mummy...

in a wall of death!

1381

inch, we're in hell.

experimenting
with the democratic process in America.

1386
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:54,900

in front ofthe TV.

1387

Thank you. So who is
this Chacko Nathan?

1393
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:11,800
There you go...

1394
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:15,800
Trouble comes in the form of a magazine.

1395
01:58:22,700 --> 01:58:23,700
What?

1396
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,200
Where're you going
smelling like that?

1397
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:27,500
l...

1398
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,700

1399
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:30,800

01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:34,800

1401
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:34,800
Any problem?

1402
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:36,900
Yes. l have a problem.

1403
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:37,300
Question: You always say that
Indians are your brothen and sisten,

1404
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:41,800
so what happened to that?

1405
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:44,400
- Dear little Varkie.
- Don't call me that.

1406
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:45,600
When you see trees,
l see the sky.

1407
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:51,100
- Understand?
- No.

1408
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,600
Her heart. l check.
At heart Indian.

1409
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,900
But she, American citizen.

1410
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:01,500
Whatever. My stomach's rumbling
like cray l'm so hungy.

1411
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:03,400
Let's get ready and
go with the boss.

1412
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:08,900
You don't have to follow me eveywhere
like a couple of stray dogs.

1413
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:16,100
Don't you wish to see me
get married and have kids?

1414
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,400
- We'll see.
- No need.

1415
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:20,600
- Hello.
- Hi, Jacks.

1416
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:26,500
- Where are we going? - We're going
to a Mediterranean restaurant.

1417
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:29,300
l hope you like
Mediterranean food.

1418
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:30,700
l like Pomeranian too.

1419
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,400
Pomeranian?

1420
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:32,900
- Jacks you are too funny.
- Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

1421
01:59:36,300 --> 01:59:37,200
Let's go.

1422
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:54,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1423
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,600
We'll have a drink?

1424
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,800
You want to have a Merlot?

1425
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,700
- You don't like Merlot?
- Marilyn Monroe?

1426
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,500
Jacks you are vey funny
and you know that.

1427
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,400
Sory. One minute...

1428
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:15,400
toilet and...

1429
02:00:16,900 --> 02:00:18,800
- Ok.
- Ok.

1430
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:29,600
l think there's a problem.

1431
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:33,600
l'll have to take someone with me
to understand what she's saying.

1432
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:37,300
What was that? Mediterranean... Merlot...
l am confused by all this.

1433
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:41,500
Merlot is a red wine that's
made from special grapes.

1434
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,400
Why can't sheiust call it wine?

1435
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:47,700
When you order Mediterranean
food, ask for hummus.

1436
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,800
lt's chickpeas. Just call it ''hummus''.
Just to show that you know.

1437
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:52,900
What's that? Hummers?

1438
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Not ''hummen'', ''hummus''.

1439
02:00:55,100 --> 02:00:55,100
Boss...

1440
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,900
What are you doing there?

1441
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:02,700
We'rejust having fun with
these princesses here.

1442
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:09,100
Let John Koy pick
up the tab forthis!

1443
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:09,800
Don't make John Koy sory!

1444
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,800
No, No, No. Shall we
take them to Kerala?

1445
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:18,800
Hummus. Merlot.

1446
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,100
Merlot. Hummus.

1447
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,100
Sory.

1448
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,100
Here's the wine for you.

1449
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:37,000
- Is eveything ok?
- Yeah ok.

1450
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:39,900
What do you want to have?

1451
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:43,500
- Hummus?
- Hummus?

1452
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:44,400
You like hummus? Even l like hummus.
With pita bread?

1453
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:49,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1454
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:52,600
Jacks, before ordering...

1455
02:01:52,900 --> 02:01:56,800
l have to tell you something
and it is vey important.

1456
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,100
Your eyes. So beautiful.

1458
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,600

1459
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:10,800
Your nose. So, so beautiful.

1460
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,200
Thanks.

1461
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,900
- Jacks can l say something?
- Your lips...

1462
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,500
So, so, so beautiful.

1463
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:24,200
l am not going any further down.

1464
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:30,000
Jacks, now can l speak?

1465
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Actually...

1466
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:36,000
My mother, she says not talking
while eating. Bad for health.

1467
02:02:36,100 --> 02:02:38,000
- Mother?
- Yeah.

1468
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:43,800
Oh, Merlot!
Nice! Good!

1469
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,500
Jacks, we need to go from here.

1470
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:49,500
- We need to go from here right now.
- Where?

1471
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,900
- Jacks get up. - What?
- Let's go from here.

1472
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,900
Let's go.

1473
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Jacks, run!

1474
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:07,100
What's this? What do you want?

1475
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:11,600

Game Over!

1481

l told you about
my husband right?

1482
02:06:54,500 --> 02:06:55,800
He was into gambling.

1483
02:06:56,900 --> 02:06:59,900
Jessi's husband was
a gambling addict.

1484
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:02,200
He gambled with
all the money he got.

1485
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:04,900
When he lost all his own
and his family's money,

1486
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:08,900
he started borrowing money
from a local thug, Tony Zebrano.

1487
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,900
ln the end, when the debts
started rising, he ran away.

1488
02:07:16,100 --> 02:07:18,600
Poor girl.

1489
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,500
Jamie. Mommy's home.

1490

Where are you Jamie. l'll
just check upstain.

1491
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:28,800
Tara...

1492
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,800
Jamie... Are you guys there?

1493
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:34,800

1495

He's demanding money.

1500

We can't let this happen.
Let's go fix it.

1506
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,100
No. Don't go. They'll kill Jamie.

Ok?

1513

But no bad things to the child.

1514
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:47,900
Bad things to the child. You remember?
That American flag? Dhoti? Flag?

1515
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:48,000
American flag. Dhoti. Ok?

1528
02:09:26,700 --> 02:09:28,200
l called you mice.

1529
02:09:28,700 --> 02:09:31,000
l was busy with the accounts.

1530
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:34,000
Come in. l wanted to
talk to you anyway.

1531
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Can you guys wait here please?

1532
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:40,000
- l have no secrets from them.
- No, it's not that.

1533
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:40,600
l want to talkto
you personally.

1534
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,500
Guys, ifyou don't mind please.

1535
02:09:46,500 --> 02:09:46,500
Boss, you go. We'll wait here.

1536
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:50,200
Ok.

1537
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,700
- Can l offer you a drink?
- No thanks.

1538
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,100
Now that the campaign is over, we
are planning to go back to Kerala.

1539
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,700
Sure. l booked your tickets.

1540
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:11,100
There is a small change
regarding the funds.

1541
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:14,100
lnstead oftransferring
all the funds to Kerala,

1542
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:16,500
l want one million
here right away.

1543
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,400
There's a small problem
with the funds Jaganathan.

1544
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:29,600
Luckily, your mad
ideas did work for us.

1545
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:30,600
But, that doesn't mean
l should give so much

1546
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:36,100
to a worthless
politician from Kerala.

1547
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:41,200
l've also spent loads for all the crap
you and your goons got up to here,

1548
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:44,400
not to mention the expenses
you guys racked up!

1549
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:46,700
How can you say that?

1550
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:51,700
l've completed the job
you asked me to do.

1551
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:55,000
Ok. l'll speak
to John ifyou like.

1552
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:57,800
l'll call him foryou...

1553
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:01,600
l have good news and
bad news for you, John.

1554
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:07,200
Well... Tell me the good news and
keep the bad news to younelf.

1555
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:08,400
Our ratings are up.

1556
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:11,800
But we have exceeded on
the budget drastically.

1557
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:15,300
Winning is OUR responsibility.

1558
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:20,400
Money is YOUR responsibility.
Not mine.

1559
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:22,200
l know that John. But we need to
pay Jaganathan for his services.

1560
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:26,500
l really need your help.

1561
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:30,100
l am going to bethe next
governor ofCalifornia.

1562
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:33,700
Do we really need
to pay that guy?

1563
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:36,200
l mean... campaign's over.

1564
02:11:39,200 --> 02:11:40,600
Pick up your drink.

1565
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,500
Welcome to politics.

1566
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:52,400
Even though your work is
done with this campaign,

1567
02:11:52,700 --> 02:11:55,400
my political career is
just starting here.

1568
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:00,100
lf l want them to consider me for
a cabinet post in the future

1569
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:04,400
it's my responsibility to keep this
election campaign cost e_ective.

1570
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:07,400
This money is vey
important for Jessi.

1571
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:11,100
l promised that l'd
get back to herwith it.

1572
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:11,200
Jessi?

1573
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:15,700
How many such Jessis do you want.
l'll arrange a thousand ofthem for you.

1574
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:19,400
Promises might be nothing
to you, but for me...

1575
02:12:22,300 --> 02:12:24,600
lt's not only Jessi who's
waiting forthe money,

1576
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:29,700
it's also the future of many talented
sports men and women in India.

1577
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:32,900
Don't get sentimental now.

1578
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:34,400
Go back to Kerala.

1579
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:37,200
Play some old politics and
Iook to earn some money.

1580
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:39,400
Take Jessi with you too
ifyou want.

1581
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:42,700
lt won't be di_icult to make
money if she's with you.

1582
02:12:52,700 --> 02:12:56,100
Don't make me swear with the same
tongue that once called you, ''Sir''.

1583
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,300
l'm asking for
the last time,

1584
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,500
areyougivingme
themoneyornot?

1585
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:04,200
Are you tying to scare me?

1586
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,300
This is a di_erent county.

1587
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,900
l iust have to make one call,

1588
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:15,200
and you'll be behind bars for the
rest ofyour life. Damn dog!

1589
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:19,400
What did you call me? A dog?

1590
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:23,200
You really don't know
what l'm capable of.

1591
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:26,600
l am not a dog.
l'm a bandicoot!

1592
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:31,400
A bandicoot digging through
your grave without you knowing.

1593
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:33,700
Do you know something?

1594
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:36,900
l've always thought ofyou
you as a bit of a comedian.

1595
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,800
Sunny. You are wrong there.

1596
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:44,100
You ask the people of Kerala.
l am not a comedian.

1597
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:46,900
l'm a hero who also knows
how to play comedy.

1598
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:52,000
l made an entire county laugh.
But, now you've made me cy.

1599
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,500
You definitely make a good villain

1600
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:57,600
Thanks for the compliment.

1601
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:04,400
But, l can take care ofthings
here myselffrom now on.

1602
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:08,400
You can go now.

1603
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:15,900
Lord Shiva has a third
eye on his forehead.

1604
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:19,500
But this Jaganathan
has eyes all over.

1605
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,700
Keep that in mind.

1606
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:41,400
- What happened?
- What happened, Boss?

1607
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:44,500
Jessi, come to
Univenal Studios.

1608
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:46,000
What happened?

1609
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,800
We have a lot ofworkto do
before tomorrow evening.

1610
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:52,500
l'll meet you in
the hotel lobby.

1611
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,000
- Do we need to come?
- No.

1612
02:14:55,300 --> 02:14:56,500
You start packing.

1613
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,700
l have to do this myself.

1614
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,800
This bandicoot's game is
just about to start.

1615
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:54,400
l don't think there's
any point waiting.

1616
02:15:54,900 --> 02:15:57,500
- Shall we call the police?
- l think we should.

1617
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:00,400
- Do you know the numbe_
- Yes, 911 .

1618
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:02,100
Shall l call?

1619
02:16:04,700 --> 02:16:05,700
ls it ringing?

1620
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:12,100
The cafs outside. l'll pack
and be back in 10 minutes.

1621
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:15,400
- Where were you?
- l'm a bandicoot...

1622
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:18,500
and you never know when l'll
arrive or when l'll leave.

1623
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,600
- What's he saying?
- No idea.

1624
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:19,100
l'm going to really miss you.

1625
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:23,500
l miss double.

1626
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:38,600
Boss...

1627
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:40,100
Give her a French kiss.

1628
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:42,000
lndian kiss is enough.

1629
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:33,800
Good morning California.
Today is election day!

1630
02:18:36,300 --> 02:18:38,300
Election day! Election day!

1631
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:40,900
The exit polls are
favoring John Koy.

1632
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:43,100
But, there's still hope
for George Hope.

1633
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:53,800
The Koy campaign was
celebrating last night

1634
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:57,100
with the latest polls showing their
ratings going through the roof.

1635
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:08,000
The first exit polls are being announced
here, and there are shocks in store.

1636
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:12,000
Going against recent opinion polls
that showed Koy well in the lead

1637
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:15,000
exit polls from voters showed both
parties hanging neck and neck

1638
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:17,100
it's too close to call who will win.

1639
02:19:25,900 --> 02:19:29,100
Just in. Democrat George
Hope wins the election.

1640
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:32,000
George Hope is the next
governor of California!

1641
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:36,300
ln a resounding victoy.
Hope secured 670/o ofthe vote

1642
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:39,400
with John Koy trailing
back with just 330/o .

1643
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:45,300
Congratulations foryour loss.

1644
02:19:45,900 --> 02:19:47,400
Mr Sunny Kurishingal.

1645
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:49,300
What cheap trick did you play?

1646
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:50,700
l told you...

1647
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:51,100
lf l know how to help you
climb up the ladder...

1648
02:19:53,800 --> 02:19:57,400
l know exactly how to
bring you down too.

1649
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,300
- You damn traitor....
- Don't raise your voice.

1650
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:04,800
Don't you want to know where
your misfortune came from?

1651
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:30,400
- Jagan, l didn't expect Sunny to
play a game like this. - Me neither.

1652
02:20:30,900 --> 02:20:33,700
And he won't expect me to
play a game like this.

1653
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:37,200
No time to waste. Have you
got the thing l asked for?

1654
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:39,400
Here...

1655
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:41,200
- Her problem first.
- Here.

1656
02:20:41,800 --> 02:20:43,700
The balance a_er our success.

1657
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:46,400
Mr Pe_ect Andy turned out
to be a real politician.

1658
02:20:47,100 --> 02:20:49,100
lf the campaign didn't
go as expected...

1659
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:54,000
l had a trump card
to make John win.

1660
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:55,300
Meet Mr Dupe Lee.

1661
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,300
Hello, Mr Hope.

1662
02:20:57,800 --> 02:21:00,900
This is the voting
machine designed by Lee.

1663
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:04,000
Even though it looks original.
It's a duplicate.

1664
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:06,900
ltjust needs some simple
re-programming,

1665
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:08,800
no matter how many
votes in the ballot.

1666
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:08,900
This is how it wo_s.

1667
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:13,200
lfJohn gets ten votes, only one
vote will be registered to him.

1668
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:15,200
The remaining nine
will go to George.

1669
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:18,000
Sir, a ten... Sachidananda
please explain...

1670
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:22,200
No need to explain.
l understood eveything.

1671
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,500
This is a true politician. One who
understands fraud in any language.

1672
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:30,000
Jack, how are you going to replace the
originals with the duplicates?

1673
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:34,800
- Jacks.
- Hey how is Jamie?

1674
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,300
- He's okay. Let's go.
- Come.

1675
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:47,400
As planned, we waited with the duplicate
machines in a duplicate truck with Dupe Lee.

1676
02:21:50,900 --> 02:21:52,400
Eveything was duplicate.

1677
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:02,800
The money that you
cheated me out of...

1678
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,900
Well, l used the same
money against you.

1679
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:10,500
Proiect ''Bribey''.

1680
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:15,400
The police here don't have pot bellies,
like they do in our county.

1681
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,400
That's the only
di_erence bemeen them.

1682
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:17,500
There's no place on
earth without an Indian.

1683
02:22:19,900 --> 02:22:22,900
But, ifthere were, you'd surely
find a Chinese guy there.

1684
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:27,100
Victorwas a Chinese man in the
California election committee.

1685
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:29,600
Dupe Lee's close friend.

1686
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,300
- Dupe Lee...
- Thanks buddy!

1687
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:36,400
Just by changing the number
plates on the trucks,

1688
02:22:40,100 --> 02:22:47,100
a never-seen-before honest
election started in California.

1689
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,900
What about the truck?

1690
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:55,100
Do you want it, Andy?

1691
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:01,300
Run!

1692
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:13,500
This is not the time
for sentiment.

1693
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:26,400
Run baby, run!

1694
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:39,000
The next governor, George
Hope, will make sure

1695
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:42,400
the news ofthe bomb and
the truck doesn't come out.

1696
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:53,100
After all, his political
consultant is me: The Bandicoot!

1697
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:10,000
l will expose all your
tricks in the media.

1698
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:14,400
The elections are over. Who is
going to believe all this now?

1699
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
People will just say that it is
the frustration of a failure.

1700
02:24:21,100 --> 02:24:25,000
Moreover, Governor George Hope is
ready to do whatever l say.

1701
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:33,300
So, l've sent John's
old sex video to him.

1702
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,600
l actually broke the original.

1703
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:41,300
But our Jabbar was such a
fan of John's pe_ormance,

1704
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,100
that he made a copy ofthe CD.
The pervert!

1705
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:48,000
- Dog! This won't end here!
- Hey...

1706
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:49,500
Don't get violent.

1707
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:51,600
Turn on the TV
and take a look.

1708
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,000
Watch the rest of
the action there.

1709
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:56,800
J Sports Academy, which
will give Kerala sports

1710
02:25:57,100 --> 02:26:00,500
an international face, is all
set for inauguration.

1711
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:05,300
J Sports Academy will open doors
for the younger generation in sports.

1712
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:10,300
Eveyone was excited to learn who
would inaugurate the academy.

1713
02:26:11,300 --> 02:26:15,100
lt will be inaugurated by
the wife of V.P Sathyan,

1714
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:18,100
the Indian footballer

1715
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:22,800
who tragically took his own life.

1716
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:27,200
The Boss is inside.
l'll call him now.

1717
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:33,000
- Look who's here.
- Hey, Jaganathan.

1718
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:35,300
- Flowers from the State of California.
- Thank you, Andy.

1719
02:26:35,500 --> 02:26:37,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1720
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,600
Good morning.

1721
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:48,600
l've always seen
you as a competitor.

1722
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,200
l lost the game
l played againstyou.

1723
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:53,800
But l'm not upset,

1724
02:26:54,300 --> 02:26:57,900
after all, l've lost playing
against a champion.

1725
02:26:59,800 --> 02:26:59,800
Don't stop with one.
Take about four or five.

1726
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:05,700
But when you update this on
Facebook, please tag me too.

1727
02:27:06,300 --> 02:27:08,700
Nowadays, we need
Facebook for eveything!

1728
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:13,800
l want to tell you something.
Please don't say, ''No.''

1729
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:15,300
l have accepted an
assignment from Pakistan.

1730
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:20,700
Elections are coming there.
You have to go.

1731
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:26,500
You haven't changed,
have you, Mr Kunjappan?

1732
02:27:28,700 --> 02:27:30,200
Sir, go and sit there.

1733
02:27:32,300 --> 02:27:33,600
He didn't fall for that.

1734
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:34,300
Hello.

1735
02:27:36,300 --> 02:27:37,300
Yes.

1736
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:40,200

1737
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:42,300
Yes, yes, yes.

1738
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:44,200
Boss. Call from Jamaica.

1739
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:45,900
Babe, l swear she's
just a friend.

1740
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:48,600
My God. How will l
make her understand?

1741
02:27:50,500 --> 02:27:51,900
Let me explain.

1742
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:54,300
l'm getting another call.
One moment.

1743

1746

Okay, okay, okay. Boss.

Going for honeymoon.

02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:18,500
Honeymoon.

1752
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:21,000
You change the

1754
